# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
####
The company, SellBy, participates in a program with Amazon and consumers called the Amazon Vine program. This particular program lets SellBy provide items to a consumer and then is guaranteed a product review. Amazon has several sets of data to peruse, however, SellBy is simply interested in what a data set looks like when statistically comparing paid and unpaid (or Vine versus non-Vine consumers) reviews. In this particular analysis, a dataset containing reviews for books sold through Amazon was analyzed to understand the trends of non-paid and paid for reviews. This analysis will help stakeholders at SellBy understand if their is a bias with paid reviews through the Vine program.
